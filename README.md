For this lab assignment we were tasked to create a sprite that was able to move using all of the arrow keys, I made a fish and a used a fish food for the coin, we had to make the food sprite spawn randomly on the canvas and then move the other sprite around to try and go get it. we also had to make it disappear when it was touched by the sprite and we had to make it so that when we press play it would multiply and spawn 5 at a time.
